# SVG Playground

This is a single page playground for me (and anyone else interested) to dip a toe into the world of SVG in a clear and simple way.  It aims to provide a quick way to see the connection between an SVG image and the markup that defines it.

### Who is this for?

Me!  (And anyone else who would like to know more about SVG.)

### Can I help?

At the moment this is a personal project.  But if you something wrong with my understanding of SVG, please open an issue and savage me mercilessly.
